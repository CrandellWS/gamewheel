# Full Tilt Mode - User Guide

## What is Full Tilt Mode?

**Full Tilt** is an exciting ladder-climbing game mode where players race to reach the top! Each spin of the wheel selects one player who climbs up one rung on the ladder. The first player to reach the top wins everything in a dramatic "all or nothing" showdown.

## Key Features

- **Ladder Climbing**: Players start at the bottom and climb one rung at a time
- **Configurable Heights**: Choose 3, 5, 7, or 10 rungs for different game lengths
- **Visual Progress**: Beautiful animated ladder display shows everyone's position
- **Dramatic Finale**: Confetti and celebration when someone reaches the top
- **Complete History**: Every ladder climb is tracked and exportable

The ladder display appears below the wheel when Full Tilt mode is active.

### Ladder Components

#### Rungs (Numbered 1-10)

- **Empty Rungs**: Display "Empty" until a player reaches them

#### Waiting to Climb Section
- Shows all players who haven't started climbing yet
- Players disappear from here when they climb to rung 1

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I change the ladder height mid-game?

**A:** Yes, but it's recommended to reset the wheel first. Changing mid-game won't affect players already on the ladder but will change the winning threshold.

### Q: What happens if I switch game modes with players on the ladder?

**A:** When you switch away from Full Tilt mode, ladder positions are preserved but the ladder display disappears. If you switch back, positions resume. Use "Reset Wheel" to start fresh.

### Q: Does the same player climb every time they're selected?

**A:** Yes! Each time a player is selected, they climb one additional rung. The first player to reach the top wins.

### Q: Can multiple players win?

**A:** No, Full Tilt is a "winner takes all" mode. Only the first player to reach the top rung wins. After they win, you can reset and start a new game.

### Q: How does this work with multi-winner selection?

**A:** In Full Tilt mode, even if you have multi-winner selection enabled (3, 4, or 8 winners), only the **primary winner** (top of wheel) climbs the ladder. This keeps the ladder mechanic simple and competitive.

### Q: Can I import/export Full Tilt games?

**A:** Yes! Full Tilt settings (ladder height) are included in wheel exports. However, current ladder positions are **not** exported - only the configuration.

## Best Practices

### For Streamers
1. **Announce the Rules**: Tell viewers it's first-to-the-top
2. **Show the Ladder**: Position the ladder display on-screen
3. **Build Suspense**: Commentate as leaders emerge
4. **Celebrate Big Moments**: When someone reaches rung 7/10, etc.

### For Events
1. **Choose Appropriate Height**: Match length to event duration
2. **Enable Chat Integration**: Let attendees join dynamically
3. **Export Results**: Save CSV for record-keeping
4. **Reset Between Rounds**: Use "Reset Wheel" for clean starts

### For Casual Use
1. **Start with 5 Rungs**: Good balance of excitement and duration
2. **Use Sound Effects**: Enable for more engaging experience
3. **Try Dark Mode**: Reduces eye strain during long sessions
